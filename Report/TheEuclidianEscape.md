# Introduction

The Euclidian Escape is a VR escape room game built with Unity for the HTC Vive headset. The player is trapped in a broken spaceship and must escape it. To achieve this goal, he must solve some riddles using in-game objects and the environment. The riddles are chained such that solving one unlocks another until the final exit.
